phase-3-Development part-1
Phase 3: Building and Developing with IoT Devices  
  
In this phase of the Smart Parking System project, we will delve into the process of deploying IoT devices 
and developing a Python script to collect and process data for efficient parking management. Our 
objective is to create a smart parking system using IoT technology.  
  
 Introduction  
The Smart Parking System project aims to optimize the parking experience by employing IoT devices to 
monitor parking spaces, provide real-time information to drivers, and enable efficient parking 
management. In this phase, we will demonstrate how to simulate an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT22 
sensor to collect environmental data relevant to parking space monitoring.  
  
 Simulating IoT Devices  
In this section, we will guide you through the process of setting up the environment for simulating the 
ESP32 and DHT22 sensor, which will be the foundation of our smart parking system.  
  
 1. Accessing Wokwi Plao tf rm  
To initiate this phase, we need to access the Wokwi plao tf rm, which serves as our virtual workspace for 
simulating the IoT devices. Follow these steps:  
  
- Start by visiting the Wokwi website at [wokwi.com](https://wokwi.com).  
  
 2. Creating a New Project  
Creating a new project on Wokwi is the initial step in setting up your virtual environment for the Smart 
Parking System. Here's how:  
  - Click the "New Project" buo tt n to create a new project. This project will serve as the workspace for 
your smart parking simulation.  
  
 3. Selecting the ESP32  
Selecting the appropriate hardware component is crucial for your IoT project. In this case, we are 
simulating an ESP32 microcontroller. Follow these steps:  
  
- In the "Select a board" section, type "ESP32" in the search bar and choose an ESP32 board model (e.g., 
ESP32 Dev Module). This selection emulates the hardware component for our smart parking system.  
  
4. Adding the DHT22 Sensor  
To measure environmental data relevant to parking space conditions, we'll simulate the use of a DHT22 
sensor. Here's how to include it in your simulation:  
  
- In the components panel on the left, search for "DHT22" or "DHT11."  
- Drag and drop the DHT22 component onto the virtual breadboard area. This action replicates the 
physical process of connecting a DHT22 sensor to the ESP32 board.  
  
Stay tuned for the next sections where we'll detail the process of connecting the components, writing 
Python code, and running the simulation to collect essential data for our smart parking system.

 SMART PARKING: PHASE – 4 
 
Note: Ensure that you have Fluer tt and Dart set up on your development environment before starting. 
 
Here's a simple Fluer tt app that displays parking availability data: 
 
1. Create a new Flue tt r projec t using the Flue tt r CLI: 
 
   bash 
   utt fl er create smart_parking_app 
    
 
2. Replace the default `lib/main.dart` with the following code: 
 
   dart 
   import 'package:utt fl er/material.dart'; 
   import 'package:http/http.dart' as http; 
 
   void main() { 
     runApp(MyApp()); 
   } 
 
   class MyApp extends StatefulWidget { 
     @override 
     _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState(); 
   } 
 
   class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> { 
     String parkingStatus = "Loading...";  
     @override 
     void initState() { 
       super.initState(); 
       fetchParkingAvailability(); 
     } 
 
     Future<void> fetchParkingAvailability() async { 
       na fi l response = await http.get('http://raspberry -pi-ip-address/parking_data'); 
       if (response.statusCode == 200) { 
         // Parse the response and update the parkingStatus variable. 
         setState(() { 
           parkingStatus = "Available"; // Replace with actual data 
         }); 
       } else { 
         setState(() { 
           parkingStatus = "Failed to load data"; 
         }); 
       } 
     } 
 
     @override 
     Widget build(BuildContext context) { 
       return MaterialApp( 
         home: Scaffold( 
           appBar: AppBar( 
             title: Text('Smart Parking App'), 
           ), 
           body: Center(              child: Column( 
               mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, 
               children: <Widget>[ 
                 Text( 
                   'Parking Availability:', 
                   style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), 
                 ), 
                 Text( 
                   parkingStatus, 
                   style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), 
                 ), 
                 ElevatedButton( 
                   onPressed: () { 
                     fetchParkingAvailability(); 
                   }, 
                   child: Text('Refresh'), 
                 ), 
               ], 
             ), 
           ), 
         ), 
       ); 
     } 
   } 
    
 
3. Update the `http` package in your `pubspec.yaml` : 
    Add the `http` package to your project's dependencies. Make sure you have the correct version 
specified. Run `utt fl er pub get` to fetch the package. 
 
   yaml 
   dependencies: 
     utt fl er: 
       sdk: utt fl er 
     http: ^0.13.3 
    
 
4. Customize and Expand: 
 
   - Replace `'http://raspberry -pi-ip-address/parking_data'` with the actual URL of your Raspberry Pi 
server. 
   - Implement the parsing logic to update the `parkingStatus` variable based on your data. 
   - Customize the UI and styling to match your app's design. 
 
5. Run Your App: 
 
   Use the following command to run your Fluer tt app: 
 
   bash 
   utt fl er run 
    
 
This basic app fetches parking availability data from a server (replace it with your Raspberry Pi's data 
source) and displays it in a simple UI. You can enhance it with additional features, real -time updates, and 
a more polished UI to create a full-edg fl ed smart parking app. 
 To design the app functions for receiving and displaying parking availability data from the Raspberry Pi, 
you’ll need to create a Fluer tt app with appropriate functionality. Here’s a step -by-step guide to design 
these app functions: 
 
1.Create a Flue tt r Project if you haven’t already, following the steps mentioned earlier. 
 
• 2. Define the Data Model: 
   - Create a data model to represent parking availability. This model should have properties to store 
information such as parking space ID, availability status (occupied/available), and any other relevant 
data. 
 
   dart 
   Class ParkingSpace { 
     Final String id; 
     Final bool isOccupied; 
 
     ParkingSpace({ 
       Required this.id, 
       Required this.isOccupied, 
     }); 
   } 
    
 
3. Fetch Data from Raspberry Pi: 
   - Implement a function to fetch data from your Raspberry Pi server. You can use HTTP requests, as 
mentioned earlier. Make sure to parse the response and convert it into a list of `ParkingSpace` objects. 
 
   dart 
   Future<List<ParkingSpace>> fetchParkingAvailability() async { 
     Final response = await http.get(‘http://raspberry -pi-ip-address/parking_data’);      If (response.statusCode == 200) { 
       Final List<dynamic> data = json.decode(response.body); 
       Return data.map((space) => ParkingSpace(id: space[‘id’], isOccupied: space[‘isOccupied’])).toList(); 
     } else { 
       Throw Exception(‘Failed to load parking availability data’); 
     } 
   } 
    
 
4. Create a UI to Display Data: 
   - Design the user interface to display parking availability data. You can use Fluer tt widgets to create a 
visually appealing UI. 
 
   dart 
   Class ParkingAvailabilityScreen extends StatelessWidget { 
     Final List<ParkingSpace> parkingSpaces; 
 
     ParkingAvailabilityScreen({required this.parkingSpaces}); 
 
     @override 
     Widget build(BuildContext context) { 
       Return Scaffold( 
         appBar: AppBar( 
           title: Text(‘Parking Availability’), 
         ), 
         Body: ListView.builder( 
           itemCount: parkingSpaces.length, 
           itemBuilder: (context, index) { 
             na fi l space = parkingSpaces[index];              return ListTile( 
               t ti le: Text(‘Space ${space.id}’), 
               subtitle: Text(space.isOccupied ? ‘Occupied’ : ‘Available’), 
             ); 
           }, 
         ), 
       ); 
     } 
   } 
    
 
5. Fetch and Display Data: 
   - In your app, call the `fetchParkingAvailability` function to fetch data and then navigate to the 
`ParkingAvailabilityScreen` to display the information. 
 
   dart 
   Future<void> displayParkingAvailability(BuildContext context) async { 
     Try { 
       Final parkingSpaces = await fetchParkingAvailability(); 
       Navigator.push( 
         Context, 
         MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ParkingAvailabilityScreen(parkingSpaces: parkingSpaces)), 
       ); 
     } catch € { 
       // Handle errors or display a message to the user. 
       Print(‘Error: $e’); 
     } 
   } 
     
 
6. Trigger Data Retrieval: 
   - You can trigger the data retrieval and screen navigation based on user interactions. For example, you 
can add a button in your app that, when pressed, calls the `displayParkingAvailability` function to fetch 
and display the data. 
 
   dart 
   ElevatedButton( 
     onPressed: () { 
       displayParkingAvailability(context); 
     }, 
     Child: Text(‘Check Parking Availability’), 
   ), 
    
 
7. Test and Enhance: 
   - Test your app on emulators or physical devices, and enhance it with features like real-time updates, 
error handling, and styling to create a complete smart parking app.  
This is a basic outline of how to design app functions to receive and display parking availability data from 
the Raspberry Pi. You can further refine and customize the app according to your specific needs and 
design preferences.
