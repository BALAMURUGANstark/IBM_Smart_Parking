Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

In this part you will need to understand the problem statement and create a document on what 

have you understood and how will you proceed ahead with solving the problem. Please think 

on a design and present in form of a document. 

Project Definition: The project involves integrating IoT sensors into public transportation 

vehicles to monitor ridership, track locations, and predict arrival times. The goal is to provide 

real-time transit information to the public through a public platform, enhancing the efficiency 

and quality of public transportation services. This project includes defining objectives, designing 

the IoT sensor system, developing the real-time transit information platform, and integrating 

them using IoT technology and Python.
Project Title: IoT-Based Smart Parking System 

Project Description: The IoT-based Smart Parking System is designed to address urban 

parking challenges by utilizing IoT technology to optimize parking space management, 

enhance user convenience, and reduce congestion. This system aims to provide real-

time parking information to users and improve parking facility management for 

operators.
